          <p class="intro__text">According to polls by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere, but only 36% plan to spend their holidays in their native country. Like, what have we not seen here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole universe with the gentle sea of ​​the south, the dense forests of the Sayans and the harsh ice of the Putorana Plateau. And you can also see all these beauties without millions in your account, a passport and many hours of flights. Like, for example, Vera Bashmakova, a brave young mother who took three children in her arms, put them in her Lada and drove 20 thousand kilometers across her native country. We have selected and described some interesting places worthy of your vacation.</p>

                First of all, because of the mountains: if you drive along the ridge, you will see slopes strewn with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes. And if you open the windows in the car, you can get acquainted with the invisible miracle of these places - mountain air.</p>
              <p class="places__paragraph">The climate in Altai is temperate, so it is best to go here in summer. So you will see all the variety of local flora and fauna. Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous manuls are also inhabitants of the Altai Territory.</p>

              <p class="places__paragraph">Of course, it's all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place for skiing competitions. This is a sport where the skier ties himself
                to the motorcycle, and the tandem tries to develop as much speed as possible on the ice. In March 2019, at the Baikal Mile festival, a world record was set - 197.011 km/h.</p>

But here it swings up to 30 meters - the forests of the Karelian national parks, due to impenetrable swamps, have never known an ax. Some pines are more than half a millennium old. Touch a living creature that saw the sun before Ivan the Terrible saw it.
                In the virgin forest for a hundred kilometers you will not find a path. And on rare paths trees
                a couple of meters from the ground are marked with bear claws. Let everyone know who's boss.</p>
